title: About Joel Fischer
---

Hello! As you have probably guessed, my name is Joel Fischer. I am a M.A. student in Christian Apologetics at [Biola University](www.biola.edu). In 2008 I graduated from L'Anse Creuse High School North as Valedictorian, then graduated from Lawrence Technological University in 2012 Magna Cum Laude with Honors with a B.A. in Computer Science. Since then I have been working on a career in software engineering, primarily working in web and Apple development with a minor in design, so to speak. I have over 15 patents pending around software and the automotive industry.

In my statement of faith, I agree with [the Apostle's Creed](http://christianity.about.com/od/christiandoctrines/qt/apostlescreed.htm) and the [Nicene Creed](http://christianity.about.com/od/christiandoctrines/qt/thenicenecreed.htm) and in *sola scriptura*. I believe that the Holy Spirit has not ceased working in the lives of the saints.

My goal in gaining my M.A. in Christian Apologetics is to be an asset to the church in growing in knowledge of our faith. I believe that 1 Peter 3:15, Philippians 1:9-10, 2 Corinthians 10:5, and 2 Timothy 2:23-26 teach us as Christians to be knowledgable in our defense and gracious in our approach to those who don't believe. I answer the call as a willing vessel for God to use in any way he pleases. I pursue that through a passionate relationship with the Holy Spirit; he leads and guides me as I seek to defend our faith.

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. (Rom. 15:13)
