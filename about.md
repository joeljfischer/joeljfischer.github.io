title: About Joel Fischer

Hello! I am a M.A. student in Christian Apologetics at [Biola University](https://www.biola.edu). In 2012 I graduated Lawrence Technological University Magna Cum Laude with Honors with a B.A. in Computer Science. Since then I have been working on a career in software engineering, primarily working in web, Apple platforms, and a bit of design. I have over 15 patents pending around software and the automotive industry.

My goal in gaining my M.A. in Christian Apologetics is to be an asset to the church in growing in knowledge of our faith. I believe that 1 Peter 3:15, Philippians 1:9-10, 2 Corinthians 10:5, and 2 Timothy 2:23-26 teach us as Christians to be knowledgable in our defense and gracious in our approach to those who don't believe. I hope and pray the Holy Spirit works upon your life and heart as he does in mine, and that my papers may be illuminating in some small way.

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. (Rom. 15:13)
